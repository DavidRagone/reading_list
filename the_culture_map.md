# The Culture Map

### Breaking Through the Invisible Boundaries of Global Business

### Erin Meyer


### 1 - Communicating: Low-Context Versus High-Context

* Americans communicate explicitly and literally, while Asians communicate implicitly and indirectly
* US values telling what you'll tell them, then saying it, then telling what you told them
* high-context culture have long history of communication; use shared-experiences to understand each other
* low context cultures rely on words and facts more than context/emotion
* when working w/ people from a different cultural context, be flexible in your communication style
* pay attention to body cues when communicating w/ people used to low-context communication (people from Asia or LatAm)
* when speaking to people used to high-context communication (from Europe), make sure to be transparent and precise

### 2 - Evaluating: Direct Negative Feedback Versus Indirect Negative Feedback

* story of french woman working for US company, who thought her first performance review went great, but boss felt very differently
* due to different perceptions of being polite and how cultures give negative feedback
* Americans struggle to give negative feedback; sugarcoat w/ positive comments (shit sandwich), afraid to make employees feel bad
* French don't mind words or try to soften blow; give direct and honest feedback w/o any praise attached
* some cultures consider it acceptable for people in authority to criticize subordinates' work in front of others
* communication styles don't always align w/ how they give feedback; e.g. Israel is high context but gives direct negative feedback

### 3 - Persuading: Principles-First versus Applications-First

* reasoning that can be used to persuade
* principles-first starts w/ theory, then provides supporting facts
* applications-first starts w/ observing patterns in the world, then deriving conclusions from those
* principles-first = cultures like Russia, Italy, France; want to know "why" before act
* application-first = US, Canada; care more about "how" to achieve the goal
* most people use both approaches at different times
* Asians tend to view objects & people relative to their environment, emphasizing connections/interaction btwn
* Western thinkers focus on object/person independent of the related environment

### 4 - Leading: Egalitarian versus Hierarchical

* Geert Hofstede = Dutch psychologist & professor who coined "power distance" = how much power people are willing to accept from others; affects leadership, hierarchy, power in organizations
* example of difference between Mexican & Dutch cultures; Netherlands is egalitarian, everyone treated as equals; in Mexico, expectation is to show respect for superiors and communicate through proper channels

### 5 - Deciding: Consensual Versus Top-Down

* consensual <--> top-down scale
* Japan at consensual end (meetings before the meeting to get to consensus at lower level before discussion at higher level)
* UK & US in middle; India, China, Nigeria at top-down end

### 6 - Trusting: Task-Based Versus Relationship-Based

* cognitive and affective trust
* cognitive trust = related to confidence in someone else's abilities
* affective trust = comes from affection for another person
* US culture separates business & personal matters; treats business relationships via cognitive trust
* different from other cultures (e.g. India, Nigeria), where more focused on affective trust
* consider building trust in two ways: understand partner's needs, meet them in timely manner (cognitive), or develop personal connections w/ business partners first and then work on projects together (affective)

### 7 - Disagreeing: Confrontational Versus Avoids Confrontation

* in France, open disagreement and debate of ideas in lively manner
* in Japan, avoid disagreements b/c prefer group harmony
* different ways of expressing emotions in different cultures
* e.g. Mexicans are comfortable showing feelings, but don't like to disagree openly or confront each other
* need to find ways to allow for disagreement, especially when you're the boss; e.g. use flip charts, sticky notes during meetings to avoid idea attribution (allows more freely sharing)

### 8 - Scheduling: Linear-Time Versus Flexible-Time

* in Germany, workers are punctual and follow schedules; linear time, rigid schedules and deadlines
* in Nigeria, people allow their environment to dictate when they work; flexible-time, allow for fluidity in workflow and simultaneous activities happening at once
