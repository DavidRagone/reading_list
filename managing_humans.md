# Managing Humans
## Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager
by Michael Lopp (aka, Rands)

Rather than recount everything, I'm going to instead make note of the various
attributes and "types" that Lopp categorized, as well as a few solid odds and
ends.

### Types of Meetings

#### Informational Meetings

Participants:
* Talkers
* Listeners

Goal: Transmission of information.

No problem to be solved other than transmission of info. Sometimes people ask
questions thinking they're going to change something. But that's not the point
of this meeting.

#### Conflict Resolution Meetings

Participants:
* Players: Want something out of the meeting. Can't identify any of these in a
  meeting? Bail. Subclasses:
  * Pros: They're on the winning side; they're getting what they want, and
    aren't incentivized to negotiate.
  * Cons: The ones being screwed.
* Pawns: Silent, or instruments of the meeting.

Goal: Figure out who wants what (the issue), and then come up with a plan to
assure the cons the issue(s) will be addressed.

### Role of the Manager

You're an information conduit. For each piece of info you get, figure out who in
your org needs it to do their job. Deceptively easy to screw up (there's a ton
of info, and you'll rarely if ever get right who to disseminate it to).

### Value of Silence

"In most businesses, everyone's basic agenda is visible after they've talked for
about 30 seconds." So listen, quietly, and learn.

### Why it's different at 100 than 20

"At an organizational size that varies for every team, natural cross-pollination
and communication activities that used to happen organically, that allowed for
cultural and strategic work to get done, and that allowed for big decisions to
be made no longer occur. The team can no longer look around the room and get a
sense for how everyone is doing because there are too many everyones."

### DNA (design 'n' architecture) meeting

In support of a flat org where leadership != management, hold a meeting of
**technical** leaders to work through tech design and architecture issues. Pure
people managers don't qualify for attendance. This is for those who go out of
their way to teach and have the ability to explain their thinking,
constructively criticize, and are drama and politics free.

Rule of DNA meetings: If you don't contribute, you're not invited back.

### How to maintain an engineering mindset

1. Use the dev environment to build the product. Be familiar with teh tools
   (build system, verison control, programming language). This keeps you in
   touch with how the team talks about how they get stuff done.
1. Be able to draw a **detailed** architectural diagram describing your product on
   any whiteboard at any time. Note this diagram changes over time, and you need
   to be able to understand why those changes are occurring.
1. Own a feature. Make it a small one. But this is what forces you to do #1.
1. Write unit tests (DR note: this one strikes me as odd. Shouldn't these
   already be there?)

### Superpowers

* **The Machine**
  * Superpower: The Debate
  * Mantra: "Without a plan, there is no hope."
  * Believes: The whole world is measurable.
  * Go to: Data (which is how the debate is decided)
  * How it works: A long and detailed analysis of pros and cons.
  * When it doesn't work: When decisiveness is needed or the issue is deeply
    emotional.
* **The Jedi**
  * Superpower: The Nudge
  * Mantra: "Help me help you."
  * Believes: He wants to be your bud.
  * Go to: Listening.
  * How it works: "The nudge is the smallest, most viral piece of constructive
    feedback you can give. It is small enough to appear unthreatening, but it
    has enough intent, enough implications, that it plants itself in the receiver's
    mind and can't help but evolve."
* **The Dictator**
  * Superpower: The Mandate
  * Mantra: "I'm the one who's telling how how it is"
  * Benefits: Fastest way forward.
  * Costs: Part of your credibility.

### Inverse Pyramid of Hierarchies

Like Maslows, but incredibly unstable b/c it's upside down. Goes: Pitch, People
Process, Product. Get one wrong, the rest falls down.

"Each layer hsapes and moves those naer it." They invade each other. The pyramid
should be consistently adjusting to keep upright.

### What process means

Process == "the means by which your team communicates"

"You just need to agree on how you're going to share information"

### Artifacts

Reinterpreting chaos to mean that everything is out to screw you, you'll realize
that poorly communicated decisions spell certain doom, and hopefully start to
produce artifacts. There's some rules in making them work. The three A's:

* Availability: Does everyone know that your artifact matters, and where to find
  it?
* Agreement: You've identified a critical (be that novel, controverial, or just
  important) piece of info. Now it needs to be common knowledge. This isn't
availability, this is everyone understanding

### Artifacts

Reinterpreting chaos to mean that everything is out to screw you, you'll realize
that poorly communicated decisions spell certain doom, and hopefully start to
produce artifacts. There's some rules in making them work. The three A's:

* Availability: Does everyone know that your artifact matters, and where to find
  it?
* Agreement: You've identified a critical (be that novel, controverial, or just
  important) piece of info. Now it needs to be common knowledge. This isn't
  availability, this is everyone understanding.
* Accuracy: The artifact will change as it goes thorugh the org. Take the time
  to revisit it and let it evolve w/ the decision it reflects.

### Bored People Quit

1. Where are they going?
1. What are you currently doing to get them there?

Keep an interesitng problem squarely in front of them.

### Interviewing

Roles (what rands refers to as "bellwethers") in interview teams:

1. Technical - Need to find a technical bully (not the great engineer who gets
   so uncomfortable around other people that they aren't able to interview
   others)
1. Cultural - Need to find someone who can determine if candidate will add or
   subtract to team. Who on your team represents the soul of your team?
1. Vision (Strategic or Tactical) - Figure out the trajectory of the candidate.
   Are they up and coming? Want to change the world? Carved out a safe little
   corner of technology? Know who you're looking to hire, and whether that
   person should be strategic or tactical. Strategic = pushes their
   agenda/opinion; will piss people off because of intensity of their agenda.
   Tactical hire will fit a well-defined need, e.g. a database person. They know
   their stuff, but that's all they know.

### Rules for starting a new job

1. Stay late, show up early
1. Accept every lunch invitation you get
1. Always ask about acronyms
1. Say something really stupid
1. Have a drink
1. Tell someone what to do (advanced)
1. Have an argument (advanced)
1. Find an inner circle (advanced)

### Meeting Creatures

* **The Anchor**
  * Slogan: "It's all about me"
  * This is the person everyone is talking to, and who will decide on whatever
    needs deciding
  * Makke sure the anchor knows their job, and make sure you have one in the
    meeting
* **Laptop Larry**
  * Slogan: "Pardon me, what?"
  * He doesn't work b/c he spends half his time half-listening to the meeting. He's a net negative, b/c he's not listening or working.
  * Ask Larry to put his computer away, or leave the meeting
  * If notes must be taken, designate one person to do it
* **Mr. Irrelevant**
  * Slogan: "I'm just happy to be here."
  * Who invited this guy? What were they trying to do? Why is this guy being
    paid to do nothing in this meeting? There's a reason he's in the meeting,
    and you need to understand it.
* **Chatty Patty**
  * Slogan: "I don't shut up"
  * Main issue is time. Figure out if Chatty Patty is actually Mr Irrelevant.
    Questions to her must be precise to contain the wandering.
  * Don't ever argue w/ Chatty Patty in a meeting setting.
* **Translator Tim**
  * Slogan: "I know every acronym ever. FTW!"
  * Utility creature. Speaks the language of everyone in the room.
  * Be wary if Tim isn't neutral.
* **Sally Synthesizer**
  * Slogan: "What he's saying is..."
  * Utility creature. Ends meetings by grabbing conversation and deriving basic
    truth of what was just discussed.
  * Must have her in the room for large group meetings b/c she doesn't miss
    anything and is aware of relative significant of what is said anad who is
    saying it.
* **Curveball Kurt**
  * Slogan: "The sky is pancakes"
  * Figure out if Kurt is Mr Irrelevant. Tricky, because you have no idea what
    he's saying. Worst is if Kurt is the Anchor.
* **The Snake**
  * Slogan: "I'm actually the anchor. Sssssssh!"
  * Some anchors like to hide. Snake move only works a few times at a company
    before word gets out who the real anchor is.

### Incrementalists and Completionists

* Incrementalists: realists. Good idea of what is achievable given a problem to
  solve. Intimately aware of resources available, shape the political landscape
w.r.t problem.
* Completionists: dreamers. Have a very good idea, and answer is to solve it right. Hate idea of having to solve a problem again in a few months. Do it right the first time.

Arguments between these two are difficult to have and resolve, because they're
fighting about how to approach problems, not the specific problem or solution at
hand.

Incrementalists need vision/goal/purpose to make all the small steps they take
add up to something meaningful.

Completionists need action. Because they see the five-year solution, which
drastically changes the immediate solution, they struggle to get anyone to
understand why they're proposing something so far from the reality every sees in
front of them.

### Organics and Mechanics

* Mechanic: Move methodically. Carefully gather info in a structured manner,
  store that info in a manner that makes it easy to find again. Quietly observe,
  stay on message. See organics as walking chaos.
* Organics: All over the place. Loud, can tell a joke. Ask seemingly meaningless
  questions. Lean in when they talk. Run on feel. See mechanics as totally uptight.

Key is to figure out which your manager is, and learn to communicate with them.
Got a mechanic manager? Have tables of data, organized project lists, etc. Got
an organic? Trust they've got a plan even though it might not be immediately
transparent.

### Inwards, Outwards, and Holistics

* Inwards: Managers responsible for a small team of folks working on a single
  product or technology. Vision is focused on team and product. Don't tend to be
  involved cross-functionally unless team has dependency on external team. Often
  junior managers, but not always the case.
* Holistics: Usually middle management. Vision is staring across the org.
  Manager of managers, multiple products & teams. Main job is to figure out what
  is going on everywhere in the organization. They actually run the company;
  spread thin acquiring info from all over the org, and have rock-star inwards to
  get the products built to spec and on time so they can focus on figuring out
  what to build next and who they're going to need to build it.
* Outwards: Senior managers, VPs, CEOs. Vision is focused on outside world.
  They care about the public perception of the company, the company's
  relationship with its customers, financial community, world. It's not their
  job to run the company on a daily basis (they hired great holistics to do this),
  but they're accountable for it nonetheless.

Problems arise when there's confusion between role and perceived role. When
someone in an inward role thinks he's a holistic, he's not listening to the engineers on the team
saying there's a problem. Similarly, when someone who is naturally an inward is
moved into a holistic's role, they want to design and ship product, not dive
into the political intrigue across the org. But it's the politics that
ultiamtely will determine the fate of the product.

Micromanagement is often the result of a manager jumping from one management
class to another.

### Free Electrons

The single most productive engineer that you're ever going to meet. Can do
anything when it comes to code.

Senior free electrons have become politically and socially aware. Many CTOs fall
into this category.

Junior free electrons have all the ability, but don't have the experience of
dealing with people. They represent the single best hire you can make as a hiring manager.

Keep the engaged. They thrive in research not implementation. They like to
define the bleeding edge.

Misdirected free electron intensity can yield odd results. Be wary what tasks
you give them, you might find they do things you didn't expect.

Free electrons sometimes will not engage and they won't explain why.

It's a team. Don't call attention to special treatment they get, and don't
necessarily treat them special treatment any more than you do others on your
team.
