* TODO: Maybe pull from [this summary](http://www.wikisummaries.org/wiki/Crucial_Conversations:_Tools_for_Talking_When_Stakes_are_High)
* Key takeaways for me were:
  * Negative conversations look like silence or violence (lashing out)
  * Only person I can change is me, so ask
    * What do I want
    * What can I do
  * Can’t have conversation if other party isn’t ready, so don’t try to force it. Create safety, use the tools, and then be patient - if they’re not interested, they’re not interested
  * Avoid thinking the world only offers fools’ choices (e.g., between “tell the truth (aka insult someone)” and “stay silent”)
    * Work towards how can both be achieved
  * Make it safe
    * Ensure others see that you care about their interests and goals
      * Create clear mutual purpose (we’re working towards same thing)
    * Ensure others know that you care about them
      * Mutual respect
  * Avoid telling yourself negative stories about others
    * Other people don’t make you feel something
    * They take actions, you interpret them, and you place intent in that interpretation - this story is dangerous
  * STATE. It stands for: 
    * Share your facts
    * Tell your story
    * Ask for others’ paths
    * Talk tentatively
    * Encourage testing
