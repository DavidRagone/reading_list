# The Leadership Pipeline

### How to Build the Leadership Powered Company

### Ram Charan | Steve Drotter | Jim Noel


### Preface to the Revised Edition: Observations from the Field

* Companies need enduring architecture to focus human resource processes and programs
  * Should establish language and processes to address issues, identify problems, and exploit opportunities
  * most developmental efforts lack this central archiecture
  * no cumulative effect from a comprehensive but flexible architecture, there's no solid base for development purposes
* highest risk external hire situation involves people who are changing companies and changing layers simultaneously
* ability to lead from a distance and communicate effectively online are skills that weren't considered until relatively recently
  * *[davidr] what are the actual traits and behaviors here?*
  * *[davidr] skill, trait, behavior, experience, pattern, tool, value - need clarity on these words*

### Introduction

* As companies grow fast, leaders must move to new leadership levels at amazing speed
* organizations often don't look at development as integral to business strategy
* common organizational mindset is to view jobs as "work to be done" not as developmental assignments
* little acknowledgment that different levels of leadership exist and that people need to make skill and value transitions at each level
* hiring gifted people makes sense as a tactic by not a strategy
  * *[davidr] why? not supported*
* different level and complexity of leadership exists at each passage
  * these turns involve a major change in job requirements, demanding new skills, time applications, and work values
* diagram on p8 - Figure 1.1
  * manage self --(passage one)--> manage others --(passage two)--> manage managers --(passage three)--> functional manager --(passage four)--> business manager --(passage five)--> group manager --(passage six)-->enterprise manager
* skill requirements = the new capabilities required to execute new responsibilities
* time applications - new time frames that govern how one works
* work values - what people believe is important and so becomes the focus of their effort
* the leadership pipeline can become clogged at the turns
* 

### Chapter 1 - Six Leadership Passages; An Overview
                                  ...

* Passage One: From Managing Self to Managing Others
  * behavioral or value-based transition
  * skills people should learn at first leadership passage include planning work, filling jobs, assigning work, motivating, coaching, and measuring the work of others
  * shift from "doing" work to getting work done through others
  * most difficult change = values. Need to learn to value managerial work rather than just tolerate it
  * value changes will take place only if upper management reinforces the need to shift beliefs and if people find they're successful at their new jobs after a value shift
* Passage Two: From Managing Others to Managing Managers
  * managers **must** be pure management
    * Divest fully of individual tasks
    * key skills to master include 
      * selecting people to turn Passage One
      * assigning managerial and leadership work to them
      * measuring their progress as managers
      * coaching them
  * need to be able to identify value-based resistance to managerial work
* Passage Three: From Managing Managers to Functional Manager
  * tougher transition than it seems
  * communication with IC level now requires penetrating at least two layers of management, which mandates development of new communication skills
  * b/c now reporting to multi-functional gm, have to become skilled at taking other functional concerns and needs into consideration
* Passage Four: From Functional Manager to Business Manager
  * most satisfying and often most challenging
  * directing and energizing finance, human resources, legal, and other support groups are crucial business manager responsibilities
* Passage Five: From Business Manager to Group Manager
  * a business manager values success of own business; a group manager values success of other people's businesses
* Passage Six: From Group Manager to Enterprise Manager
  * more focused on values than skills
  * long-term, visionary thinkers
* [by establishing training relative to the leadership levels & passages] HR could make development decisions based on where people fall short in skills, time applications, and values rather than rely on generalized training
* number of passages varies by company. REQUIRED: proper differentiation, with even spacing between the layers
* strong technical people need to have their own passages

### Chapter 2 - From Managing Self to Managing Others

* major transition, few adequately prepared
* may recognize transition intellectually but still reject is psychologically
* often seen doing IC work, or competing for ICs on assignments; hard to give up tasks that earned this change

|        | Individual Contributor | First-Line Manager |
|--------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Skills | * technical or professional proficiency<br> * Team play<br> * Relationship building for personal benefits, personal results <br> * Using company tools, processes, and procedures | Planning - projects, budget, workforce<br> * Job design<br> * Selection (of people)<br> * Delegation<br> * Performance monitoring<br> * Coaching and feedback<br>*Performance measurement<br> * Rewards and motivation<br> * Communication and climate setting<br> * Relationship building up, down, sideways for the unit's benefit<br> * Acquisition of resources |
| Time Application | * Daily discipline - arrival, departure<br> * Meeting personal due dates for projects -- usually short-term by managing own time | Annual planning -- budgets, projects<br> * Making time available for subordinates -- both at your request and at theirs<br> * Setting priorities for unit and team<br> * Communication time with other units, customers, suppliers |
| Work Values | * Getting results through personal proficiency<br> * High-quality technical or professional work<br> * Accepting the company's values | * Getting results through others <br> * Success of direct reports<br> * Managerial work and disciplines<br> * Success of unit<br> * Self as manager<br> * Visible integrity |

* Monitoring. Ask questions about what's getting in the way of completing tasks effectively or what might facilitate the process
* Highly interdependent. Need to build trust and open lines of communication vertically and horizontally 
  * *[davidr] and random dotted lines*
* ICs need to understand what's required of them as they move through first leadership level, and need to understand it **in specific rather than general terms**
* Methods of learning
  * Coaching-Feedback
  * Peer Learning and Partnering
  * Meetings, Readings, and Travel - staff meetings where first-time managers talk about what they've learned during past month (or longer period)
  * Assigned readings - articles, books, etc
* First-time managers need to practice and perfect their skills first; this triggers process by which they learn to allocate time differently and recognize the importance of shifting their values
* Need to prune this layer of management at least once a year. Reassign first-line managers with 6-12 months on the job

### Chapter 3 - From Managing Others to Managing Managers

* false assumption: there's little difference from prior role
* viewed as a stepping stone rather than major career passage
* significant difference in skills, time applications, and work values
* Signs of Misplaced Manager of Managers
  * Difficulty Delegating
  * Poor Performance Management; unable to communicate productively w/ direct reports
  * Failure to Build Strong Team; critical to see team of managers sharing information and ideas
  * A Single-Minded Focus on Getting the Work Done
  * Choosing Clones over Contributors
* Focus areas for managers of managers
  * Select and train first-line managers
  * Hold first-line managers accountable for managerial work
  * Deploy and redeploy resources among units
  * Manage boundaries that separate units w/in org and w/ other parts of the business
* boundary management; e.g. understanding and conveying the functional strategies, business strategies, and corporate mission. Helps keep units working with other groups to achieve business goals and transcend functional goals
* Measurements of managers of managers:
  * Amount of improvement in efficiency
  * Degree of improvement in quality
  * Frequency and impact of coaching sessions
  * Number of first-line managers promoted to bigger jobs or moved laterally for broadening experiences
  * Success rate of new first-line managers
  * Teamwork within the assigned area
  * Teamwork with other areas
* Learning to ask right questions is especially tricky (new) skill
  * can't ask manage self or manage other questions (e.g., "When will you be finished with this project?" or "why is quality slipping?") b/c people will take personal responsibility for getting things done
  * need to ask management and leadership questions, e.g. "What should you do to your organization to assure that due dates are met?" or "How well do your people understand the quality standards and what are you doing to assure they meet them?"
  * Failure to ask the right level of questions inhibits development
* This role suffers from being in "no man's land" - not setting company direction/strategy, not supposed to do technical work or given directions to ICs
* Need to ask enough of managers of managers - e.g., have them participate in developing budgets and long-term planning; make sure right work is done at right cost

### Chapter 4 - From Managing Managers to Functional Manager
* knows doesn't have all the information needs and isn't sure whether all information has is correct; must therefore become skilled interpreter and seeker of information
* mature leaders have developed empathy, timing, judgment, and sources of information; learned to absorb information from sources inside and outside org and through formal and informal means
* organizations should have young, high-performing people serving on task forces, committees, project teams, and give them other assignments that force them to plan and implement ideas that transcend their functions
* Leadership immaturity can be difficult to identify
* best functional managers think strategically and manage with whole function in mind
* nature of working w/in a function is to think tactically and be responsible for one or two aspects of that function
  * most functional managers come up by performing well in one or perhaps two areas
  * e.g., head of marketing will have excelled in one of advertising, communications, brand management, product management, direct marketing, and so on
  * *[davidr] What are the equivalent eng areas? server, mobile, infra, hardware, qa, web, etc...*
* Up to this level, managers spent time creating supporting operating plans in given area for their function for the functional strategy; now must shift to creating functional strategy. Need:
  * Longer-Term Thinking (3-5 years)
  * State-of-the-Art Awareness (what's technically, operationally, and professionally possible)
  * Complete Understanding of the Business Model in Detail and Long-Term Strategic Direction and Goals
  * Ability to Make Trade-offs within the function that support business strategy, profitability, and competitive advantage (rather than just supporting functional success)
* Listening sessions w/ people at all levels. Focus on
  * What are people working on?
  * Are they being managed, developed, rewarded, and coached properly?
  * Do they understand enough of the business strategy, profit model, functional strategy, business challenges, competitive conditions, and short-term priorities to do the job right?
  * What problems are they encountering?
  * What are the obstacles?
  * What ideas do they have for improving their contribution, the function, or the company?
  * What innovation is taking place?
  * Is there sufficient speed in decision cycle times?
* Functional leaders love to learn what they don't know
* to help these managers grow, place them on task forces, teams, and committees of managers from different functions or sub-functions with different backgrounds, skills, and experience
* best method of training is hands-on learning activities in which manager uses the function's own data, challenges, and resources in a strategy-related assignment

### Chapter 5 - From Functional Manager to Business Manager

SKIPPED. Will return to in the future

### Chapter 6 - From Business Manager to Group Manager

SKIPPED. Will return to in the future

### Chapter 7 - From Group Manager to Enterprise Manager

SKIPPED. Will return to in the future

### Chapter 8 - Diagnostics

* value shifts and time re-applications are absolutely critical
* every organization has people working at the wrong leadership levels. Most common:
  * First-line managers spending most of their time doing IC work
  * Business managers doing functional work
  * Group executives focusing on business manager work
* Assessing individuals quickly and accurately
  * Identify behaviors and work production through observing and talking to them
  * Look at their calendar to determine how spending time
  * Find out what work they're producing and the major focus of their efforts
  * Figure out what they do first thing each day; who meets w/, what type of work reveals priorities
  * Discover impact on others; direct reports, past and present, as well as people in other units. Developed direct reports effectively for current leadership levels? Interact well & frequently with people from other units?
  * Overlay information on the Pipeline model. Analyze how actions & attitudes align or misalign with given level's skills, time applications, and values
  * Determine level at which they're actually working versus should be

### Chapter 9 - Performance Improvement. Clarifying Roles and Creating Performance Standards

* Performance dimensions [**DISCUSS**]
  * Operating results (revenues, cost, profit)
  * Customer results (acquisition, retention, penetration, satisfaction)
  * Leadership results (setting direction, communicating, developing people, setting standards)
  * Management results (control, quality, timeliness)
  * Relationships (working relationships, team play, internal and external, business and government)
  * Social responsibility (doing right by the community, governments, and environment)
  * Individual technical competence (those parts of the work that only you should do)
* *[THINK] what would it look like to detail those for each level at (current company)?*
* Critically important to define exceptional performance for each performance standard to prevent effective from being viewed as exceptional
* For exceptional results to be exceptional, must have been achieved for significant period of time, usually three years [**DISCUSS**]
* standards must be tailored to each level's skills, time applications, and values
* The circles [p 188-189] :-D Full performance (circle filled w/ lines representing each standard), Not Yet Full Performance (gap inside), Exceptional performance (full circle and lines extending out), and Inappropriate performance (lines extending out w/ gaps inside)
* As appoint individuals to new leadership passages, immediately create performance gap b/c they can't possess all skills, time applications, and values required for success at new level [**DISCUSS** - how does this differ from our promo approach?]
* Action Learning - involves setting up teams of leaders who are all on same level and assigning them highly challenging task related to significant business objective
  * stretch assignment, demand participants develop new skills, time applications, and values to succeed
  * significant amount of time given to learning (guest speakers, research), team-building exercises, coaching, and reflection
  * real business challenges integrate w/ personal growth and team activities so participants take it seriously
  * end process often involves a presentation to a top executive; careers are impacted
  * A coach facilitates the process
  * *[THINK] what are (current company's) cross-cutting problems that we could benefit from solving?*

### Chapter 10 - Succession Planning

* traditionally, succession planning is equated w/ replacement planning
* jobs must change to keep pace w/ ongoing changes in markets, products, business structures, and leadership requirements
* "talent inventory": flawed from pipeline perspective, b/c it equates potential w/ performance
* Succession planning is perpetuating the enterprise by filling the pipeline with high-performing people to ensure that every leadership level has an abundance of these performers to draw from, both now and in the future
* Three Categories of Potential
  * **Turn potential** - Able to do the work at the next level in three to five years or sooner
  * **Growth potential** - Able to do the work of bigger jobs at the same level in the near term
  * **Mastery potential** - Able to do the same kind of work currently being done, only better
* pipeline isn't a straight tube, but filled w/ 90 degree bends. At each, people need to slow down to reflect, learn, and develop; acknowledging the track they're on will help them know the potential they have and set them up to willingly tackle the right assignments for their future
* Need standards for each category of potential
* Need to see an individual sustain a high level of performance (three years at least) to be considered turn potential
* See exhibit 10.1, page 212-213 for example standards for judging each of 3 types of potential
* 9 box on p 216 (performance & potential) [**DISCUSS** Who's done one of these? Helpful? Better w/ three categories of potential? ]
* Compare to leadership pipeline-based 9 box: Mastery/Growth/Turn "likely future work contribution" vs exceptional/full/not yet full "sustained performance level"
* Each leadership level should be looking at the ratings for at least two of the levels beneath them
* Can't jump to filling in 9-box. Need to start from defining standards, clear job expectations, then measure and evaluate

### Chapter 11 - Identifying Potential Pipeline Failures

* purely functional value system asks "Can we do it?"; business manager asks "Should we do it?"; group executive asks "Which choice will give us the best result now and in the future?"
* All managers, on being appointed to a new leadership level, should take it upon themselves to define their job
  * not only skills, time applications, and values for level but also the performance standards
  * never take job definitions for granted
  * take initiative to define jobs for self, and define w/ specificity
  * establish how will be measured and identify differences between role and those of people above and below
  * Present to boss this understanding of what the job entails, and ask "Is this right?" NOT A QUESTION TO ASK ONLY ONCE. Discuss on a regular basis

### Chapter 12 - The Functional Career Passage

SKIPPED. Will return to in the future

### Chapter 13 - Coaching

* *[davidr] do we mean the same thing by coaching? these questions are one-time use, not for regular coaching*
* Three key questions to ask during coaching sessions
  * "Tell me about your career - your jobs, the work you did, achievements, key challenges, and learning.". Purpose = locate positions they held on pipeline. Did they skip a level? Mastered each level's skills, time applications, and values?
  * "Talk about your current position. What are your issues, challenges, and achievements? What does your calendar look like, what skills do you rely on most to get the job done, and what beliefs govern your work?" Purpose = Determine whether person understands and is mastering appropriate skills, time applications, and values for their level. Assess whether obvious developmental needs exist
  * "What are your career aspirations?" Purpose = Identify future development needs, given diff between current and aspiration. Suggest types of experience to help achieve goal. 
* Managers often need to learn to coach. Not taught
* Helpful to talk in terms of the passages. "If you're going to make it through the second leadership passage, you need to let go of value A and adopt value B; you have to let go of skill C and acquire skill D;  you have to let go of spending your time that way and learn to spend your time this way"

### Chapter 14 - Benefits Up and Down the Line

SKIPPED. Will return to in the future
