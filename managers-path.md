# The Manager's Path
### A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth & Change
### by Camille Fournier

## 1 - Management 101

* expect 1-1s to be scheduled w/ some predictability so you can plan for them
* not your maanger's job to completely control the 1-1 agenda
* getting behavioral feedback can be pretty disorienting thing to have happen
* lots of types of feedback you may want to ask for; key is to ask; figure out what you need and be explicit w/ your mgr
* your mgr should show you larger picture of how your work fits into team's goals
* as you become more senior, amount of personal feedback you get likely to decrease; expect type of feedback to change from personal to team or strategy related input
* as become more senior, mgr expect you to bring solutions, not problems; don't expect mgr to solve problems; when have problem, try asking for advice on how mgr might approach it

## 2 - Mentoring

* mentoring means feeling of being responsible for another person
* taste of mgmt
* early lessons in leadership = people are not good at saying precisely what they mean in a way that others can exactly understand
* incredibly important to set expectations - communicate what needs to happen

## 3 - Tech Lead

* good communicator, good at prioritizing, eager to push work forward, decide what needed to be done next, and willing to pick up the pieces and do what needed to be done to make progress
* tech lead is not the job for the person who wants the freedom to focus deeply on the details of her own code
* write code, but also represent group to mgmt, vet plans for feature delivery, deal w/ lot of the details of project mgmt process
* tech lead must learn to be strong technical project manager; scale themselves by delegating work effectively w/o micromanaging
* must figure out how to balance technical commitments w/ work the whole team needs
* main roles of tech lead
  * systems architect & business analyst
    * think through externalities and issues related to the project
    * good sense of overall architecture of systems
    * solid understanding of how to design complex software
    * understand business requirements and tranlsate them into software
  * project planner
    * break work down into rough deliverables
    * challenge is getting as much productiv work done in parallel as possible
    * find places to apply agreed-upon aabstractions to parallelize work
    * gataher input from experts on team
    * start identifying priorities; what's critical, what's optional? how can you work on critical early in project?
  * software developer and team lead
    * write code, communicate challenges, delegate
    * you should continue writing code, but not too much
    * even if tempted to pull rabbit out of hat yourself, you must communicate this obstacle first
    * PM should know as early as possible about any possible challenges
    * teams often fail b/c they overworked themselves on a feature that PM would have been willing to compromise on
* agile softare development does not get rid of need for project management
  * agile forces you to focus on breaking tasks down, planning those chunks out, and delivering value incrementally instead of all at once
  * none of this means you don't need to understand how to do project management
* engineers who bleieve in "right tool for the job" [dmr: one of my biggest pet peeves] sometiems turn into process czars when they become tech leads
* better: someone who understand that process must meet needs of team and work
* look for self-regulating processes; see if process itself can be changed to be easier to follow; automation can often make rules more obvious
* how to be a great tech lead
  * understand the architecture
    * understand connections, where data lives, how it flows between systems
    * how it reflects products it is supporing
    * where core logic lives
    * impossible to lead projects well when you don't undersatnd architecture you're changing
  * be a team player
    * stop doing all teh interesting work yourself
    * look at the trickiy, boring, or annoying areas of technical need and try to unstick them
    * less exciting parts of codebase can teach you a lot about where the process is broken
    * if only doing most boring work, stop that; take on some of the harder tasks
    * want to encourage others to learn entire system, give them changes to stretch themselves, but you needn't always be self-sacrificing
  * lead technical decisions
    * being involved in decisions is not same as making all the decisions
    * w/o soliciting input of team, they'll resent you and blame you when things go wrong
    * if you make no technical deicsions, they can drag on w/o resolution
    * make it clear what the matter under discussion is and communicate the outcome
  * communicate
    * your productivity is now less important than the productivity of othe whole team
    * you pay the price of communication overhead
    * instead of every member of team in a meeting, you represen the team, communicate their needs, and bring info from that meeting back to the team
    
## 4 - Managing People

* "new manager" is an entry level job w/ no seniority on any front
* 2 jobs: manage individuals while simultaneously being responsible for running a team
* expectation setting by you shoudl include specifics: how often you want to meet, how share info, how often review work, how long they work alone to solve a problem before asking for help
* the to-do list meeting
  * updates are given, decisions are made or discussed, planning happens
  * downside: wonder why you needed to do this synchronously
  * oculd have been handled via chat/email
  * encourage meaningful items for 1-1 discussion, those that need nuance of face-to-face verbal communication
* the catch-up
  * listen to anything direct reports want to discuss
  * as much creative discussion as planning meeting
  * downfall: can turn into complaining session or therapy; unhealthy closeness w/ directs
* feedback meeting
  * informal feedback and coaching
  * regular interval, especially for early-career employees
  * if have performance issues, more frequently; if thinking of firing someone, document the meetings
  * when someone does something that needs immediate corrective feedback, don't wait for 1-1 to provide that feedback
* the progress report
  * when managing ICs, should only do progress report 1-1s for someone who's off on a side project that you're not personally overseeing
  * if your 1-1s are frequently status updates, try breaking out of habit bya sking reports to preapre answer toq uestions that are unrealted ot the current project status, or ask them to come prepared w/ questions for you to answer about the team, the company, or anything else
* getting to know you
  * not suggesting pry into personal lives, but show them you care
* keep notes in shared doc, you as manager playing note taker [dmr: downside if it means looking at laptop during meeting; less personal; i'm going to try writing notes after meeting]
* micromangement vs delegation
  * instead of sitting in on every meeting and tracking every detail, work w/ IC to determine which meetings mgr should attend, help IC undertand which details to escalate; gives IC confidence to run project and understanding that (and how) mgr has ICs back
* use team's goals to understand which details to dig into
  * ask team how they're measuring success, ask them tomake that visible to you on an ongoing basis
  * if team is making progress on its goals, systems are stable, PM is happy, rarely dig into details beyond cursory overview; but requires goals w/ plan for people to be making progress against, and PM who can give you another perspective
  * when managing team that doens't have a clear plan, use details you'd want to monitor to help create one
  * what arey ou holding them accoutable against this month, quarter, year? if you can't answer that questions, first step is to help them create these goals
* gather info from systems before going to the people
  * systems can push valuable info up (version control, ticketing, alerts, metrics, etc)
* adjust focus depending on stage of project
  * during nomrla workflow, usually enough to know what's moving forward, what is taking longer than expected
* estalbish standards for code and systems
  * define what's SOP vs what's exceptional - basic standards
* teach what ICs need to communicate, when, and how
* giving continuous feedback
  * know your people
    * what are their goals, if any?
    * strengths, weaknesses?
    * at what level are they operating?
    * where might they need to improve to get to next level?
    * sit down with every person on team and ask for their perspective on these questions
  * observe your people
    * attempting continuous feedback forces you to start paying attentino to individuals on your team
    * practice looking for talents and achievements
    * give specific praise
  * provide lightweight, regular feedback
  * provide coaching
    * use coaching to ask people what they might have done differently
    * many people will be content w/ doing the job they know how to do well, as long as they are doing it well enough, it's not good use of your time to coach tehm; save valuable coaching time for those who are receptive to it
* performance reviews
  * if feedback seems valuable for person to hear, share it, but don't just blindly report all grudges
  * when very little meaningful feedback for improvement, indicates person is ready to be promoted or given more challenging work
  * some people may never need to be promoted out of their current level, but they can also grow by focusing on new technical learning opportunities
  * avoid surprises
    * if someon recently promoted, set expectation that review will be based on higher standards
* person who has potential but isn't yet showing equivalent performance is showing up for the team in a way that others do not, even if her work is slow-going
* understand that promotions involve playing a game at any sizable company; will be reviewed by your manager and committee, prepare them with the info they need to succeed
  * learn how to play the game at your company
  * if you don't know, ask your mgr for advice
  * how are decisions made? how early do you need to start preparing packets?
  * are there limits on the number of promotions that can happen in a given year?
  * be transparent with your team about why they're not getting promoted - what they need to do to make a stronger case next time
  * idetnify promotion-worthy projects, given those to people who are close to promotion
* if there's no growth potential on your team b/c there's no room for people to work at a more senior level, may be sign that you need to rethink way work is done in order to let individuals take on bigger responsibilities
* if you avoid tackling negative feedback until it builds to boiling point, you're going to be met w/ pile of excuses, and then what do you do?
* "coaching out": make situation clear to IC; have told them repeatedly what next level looks like, they haven't been able to shwo they can work at that level, so you don't think your team is the right place for them to grow their career; aren't firing them, but you are telling them that they need to move on if they want to progress

## 5 - Managing a Team

* identify bottlenecks in progress, roadblocks to success; clear them
* identify most high-value projects, keep team focused on them
* idnetify headcount needs for team, plan and recruit
* communicate expectations clearly to all team members
* deliver individual feedback frequently
* act as leader for technical roadmap; clearly communicate timeline, scope, and risks, lead delivery of major initiatives on clear timelines
* identify areas fo strategic techniacl debt, do cost/benefit analysis for resolving it
* when working with more senior engineers than you are, talk about how everyone has a job to do; EMs is to help them succeed however EM can; being good manager isn't about having most technical knowledge
* negative person easier to deal w/ than brilliant jerk; make it clear behavior has to change, bring clear examples, provide corretive feedback quickly after things happen
* humans need context on why goals have been set; can't shield team from everything happening or they may lack that context
* role in decision making process is to drive good decisions
  * PM owns product roadmap
  * tech lead is deep in tech, but also thinking about project mgmt and work that needs to be done
  * you are accoutable for team's progress through each of these elements
  * while you may only have the authority to guide decisions rather than dictate them, you'll still be judged by how well those decisions turn out
* use data
  * team productivity (time to complete features)
  * quality measures (how mcuh tiem spent dealing with outages, number of bugs found in QA or after releases)
* create safe environemtn for diagreement to work itself out
* managing conflict
  * don't rely exclusively on consensus or voting
  * set up clear processes to depersonalize decisions (aka, guide) - provide clear set of standards to evaluate decisions; start w/ shared understanding of goals, risks, questons to answer
  * don't turn blind eye to simmering issues
  * address issues w/o courting drama; goal is to identify problems that are causing the team to work less effectively together and resolve tehm, not to become the team's therapist
* nice vs kind: nice is good in casual conversation; as mgr, important ot be kind instead. e.g., it's kind to tell someone who isn't ready for promotion that they're not ready; unkind to lead that person on saying "Maybe you coudl get promoted"
* underpinning of a successful team is psychological safety: team whose members are wiling to take risks and make mistakes in front of one another
* the brilliant jerk
  * all evidence in the world can't change a person who doesn't want to change
  * best thing for team is to refuse to tolerate bad behavior
  * few instances where okay to criticize in public
  * keep feedback neutral but to the point
  * only for behavior you believe is detrimental to the whole group; if just undermining you personally, discuss in private
* employee who lacks respect -  ask if she wants to be working on your team
* advanced project mgmt
  * none of this is a replacement for agile project mgmt
    * teams have both high-level, long-term goals and short-term objetives to meet those goals
    * agile process where team collaborates to divide and roughly estimate work is very effective at smoothing and organizing the day-to-day
    * as mgr, you're not trying to disrupt or even own that part of the execution process
    * you are responsible for the larger picture - accomplishments that are measured in months intead of weeks - and this is where you have to start exerting some higher-level planning
  * 10 productive engineering weeks of focused effort per engineer per quarter
  * q1 most productive, q4 least
  * budget 20% time for generic sustaining engineering work across the board - testing, debugging, cleaning up legacy code, migrating language or platform versions, etc
  * it's your job to say no as you approach deadlines
    * will almost certainly have deadlines, either goal dates that you've set or that came from on high
    * only way to achieve them is to cut scope at end of project
    * partner with tech lead and product lead / business rep to figure out what "must-haves" are not actually that
    * figure out when to push for hack implementation, when to hold back for right implementation
  * use doubling rule for quick estiamtes, push for planning team to estimate longer tasks
    * when asked for off-the-cuff guess, double
    * when talking about projeects longer than a couple of weeks, make it clear you'll need some planning time before you're sure about the timescale
  * be selective about what you bring to the team to estimate
    * part of your job is to handle uncertainty, limit how much of that uncertainty you expose to your team

## 6 - Managing Multiple Teams

* strong technical background
* spend some of time researching new technologies and staying abreast of tends in tech industry
* expected to help debug and triage critical systems
* understand systems they oversee well enough to do code reviews, research problems as needed
* contirbute to architecture and design efforts by serving as tech savvy voice that asks business and product questions of engineers
* primarly concerned w/ ensuring smooth execution fo complex deliverables
* responsible for guiding goal-setting process for all teams in org, helping these teams articulate goals that support both business initiatives and technology and organizational quality
* ways to stay hands-on that don't require wiring a lot of production code: code reviews, debugging and prod support
* even if don't write much code, keep at least solid half-day once a week completely free from meetings for creative pursuit; write blog posts, prep conference talks, participate in open source project; scratch creative itch
* key skill is understanding difference between importance and urgency

|   | Not urgent | Urgent |
|-----|--------|------|
|Important | Strategic: make time | Obvious work |
|Unimportant | Obvious avoid | Tempting distractions (danger zone) |

* urgency is often more clearly felt than importance
* manage time by, e.g., reading and responsing to email at specific times of day
* important but not urgent: preparing for meetings so you can guide them in a healthy way
  * culture that favors short but productive meetings requires participants do some up-front work to come to the meeting prepared
  * hold people accountable to prepare in whatever way makes sense
  * ask for agenda items up front
  * any standard meeting should have clear procedure and expected outcomes
* urgent but not important meetings can be tempting to not attend; be careful to over-deploy this strategy; your attendance at these meetings is partially to pay attention to the dynamics and morale of your team
* have mental list of things about what your team needs; that you're monitoring, trying to fix, trying to find for them
* decisions and delegation

| | Frequent | Infrequent |
|--|---|---|
| Simple | Delegate | Do it yourself |
| Complex | Can delegate (carefully) | Can delegate for training purposes |

* delegate simple and frequent tasks
  * running daily standups, writing summary of team's progress each week, conducting minor code reviews
  * tech leads or other senior engineers can take responsibility for those tasks, may not even need training to do them
* simple and infrequent do yourself
  * if faster to do it yourself than explaining to someone else, and rarely needs to be done, do it
* complex and infrequent tasks as training opportunities for rising leaders
  * writing performance reviews, making hiring plans are skills you'll want to pass on to rising mgrs
  * may have tech lead sit with you to write perf review for an intern
  * have senior eng provide feedback on how many new people believes needed to support a project next year
* delegate complex & frequent tasks to develop team
  * project planning, systems design, being key person during outage are biggest opportunity to grow talent while making team run better
  * goal is to make teams capable of operating at high level w/o much input from you
  * are your teams learning how to operate independently, or are you keeping them dependent on you for critical functions? list taks you and only you know how to do for the team; many are important to teach your teams to accomplish themselves
  * project mgmt, onbaording new team members, working w/ product team to break down roadmap goals into technical deliverables, production support
* delegation is a process that starts slwo but turns into essential element for career growth
* lack of engagement in meetings tends to mean team isn't engaged by work or do not feel like they have a say in the decision-making process
* strategies for sayign no
  * manager's job involves making it easy for employees to get things done by creating fertile environments in which work can happen
  * enabler, coach, champion
  * sometimes have to say no; no to team, no to peers, no to boss
  * Yes, And...
    * saying no to boss is rarely actually a matter of saying "no"
    * "Yes, we can do that proejct, and all we will need to do is delay the start of this other project that is currently on the roadmap"
    * responding positively while still articulating the boundaries of reality [dmr: THIS]
    * it's a positive no - not the knee-jerk "no, that can't happen"
    * this transforms contentious disagreements into realistic negotations for priority
  * create policies
    * help team understand what it takes to get to "yes"
    * when you start repeating yourself, you have the absis for a reasonable policy
    * hard requirements that must be met inorder to say yes
    * guidelines for thinking about the decision
  * help me say yes
    * ask questions and dig in on elements that seem questionable to you
    * often helps people come to realization themselves that tehir plan isn't a good idea
  * appeal to budget
    * lay out current workload in plain terms, show how there is little room to maneuver
    * coupled with "not right now" (another somewhat passive-aggressive way of saying no)
  * work as a team
    * will be times whne you and your peers, especially across function (pm, biz, etc), will need to act together to say no
  * won't have luxury to carefully investigate and analyze every decision, so practice getting comfortable with quick no and quick yes for low-risk, low-impact decisions
* turn your technical focus to observing and improving systems of work
  * develop an eye for the tehcnical health signals for the team
  * 3 questions for _First, Break All the Rules_
    * Do I know wfhat is expected of me at work?
    * Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?
    * Do I have the opportunity tod o what I do best every day?
  * frequency of code releases, frequency fo code check-ins, infrequency of incidents are all key inndicators of team that knows what to do, has tools, has time to do it every day
* design systems and processes that will keep thing smoving; create the tools that developers need to do their jobs; always ask yourself if they can be automated further
* as technical leader, you're still repsonsible for the technical side of getting work done
  * also responsible for keeping your team happy and productive, and often the solution is not paying them more or cheerleading; it's enabling them to be more productive, challenign them to go faster and do better work
  * dmr: Ask your team: How could you do more / go faster / be more productive?
  * have to be advocate and push for technical process improvemens that can lead to increased engineer productivity
* analysis around incident mgmt should include the question: "Is our current setup enabling my team to do what they do best every single day?"
  * incident mgmt when merely reacting to incidents rather than working to reduce them diminishes team's ability to do what they do best
* purpose-based binding: strong alignemtn between the team, its individuals, and the overall company
  * purpose-driven teams are more open to new ideas and value changes that can help them serve their purpose better
* impatience and laziness, when applied to process, are the key elements to focus
  * what you want to teach is how to focus
  * practice modeling figuringout what's important, and going home
  * any time you see something beinng done that feel inefficient, question it
    * what is the value in the thing we are doing?
    * can we deliver that value faster?
    * can we strip down this project into something simpler and get it done more quickly?
  * "faster" is not about the same number of hours but fewer total days, it's about the same value to the company in less total time

## 7 - Managing Managers

* not that differenet from managing multiple teams
* difference is one of magnitude; coverage area for those teams has increased, more people and proejcts than you could possibly handle by yourself
* may manage a larger scope of efforts
* need to follow-up on all the little things until you figure out what you don't need to follow up on; is recruiting happening? are mgrs coaching their teams? has everyoen written up goals for the quarter? have you reviewed them? what is thhe status of that project that should be finishing up? did the postmortem happen for that prod incident from the other day? did you read the report?
* part of the job of mgr is to ferrret out problems proactively - hence open door policies don't really get you to effectively do your job
* skip-level mtgs: purpose is to help you get perspective on the health and focus of your teams
* most successful when you provide prompts about potential topics, remind person that the meeting is largely for his or her benefit; each person should come prepared to focus onw hat he/she is interestedd in talking about
  * some suggested prompts
    * what do you like best/worst about the project you are on?
    * who on your team has been doing really well recently?
    * do you have any feedback for your mgr - what's going well, what isn't?
    * what changes do you think we could make to the proudct?
    * are there any opportunities you think we might be missing?
    * how do you think the organization is doing overall? anything we could do better/more/less?
    * are there any areas fo the business strategy you don't understand?
    * what's keeping you from doing your best work right now?
    * how happy (or not) are you working at the company?
    * what could we do dto make working at the company more fun?
  * can do skip-level lunches; doesn't give you focus to give career coaching to individuals, but does help you get sense of the group dynamics and get feedback directly from teams; they may feel uncomfortable complaining in fron tof others about problems they're having w/ their mgr
* manager accountability
  * your mgrs are responsible for taking a team of people and helping that team succeed
  * you have to hold them accountable
  * accountability on complex teams is often muddled - constantly changing product roadmaps from PM, errant tech lead, full-time firefighting mode are all problems that can arise and aren't really owned by EM
  * but in all cases, the EM is accountable; despite mitigating circumstances in each case, mgr ultimately needs to take responsibility for pulling the team out of these situations and getting them moving forward, b/c **EM is accountable for the health and productivity of the team**
  * you'll need to help your mgrs
  * sometimes they don't have the clout to push back against product and need your support
  * may need your help finding other senior people to partner with their tech lead
  * support them inshifting support burdene to other teams
  * they've done hard work of identifying the problems that are slowing down their teams, you need ot help them find the solutions or support the path forward
  * EMs job is to bring you clear problems before they turn into raging fires
  * in all this, ensure you make time for feedback and coaching
* managing new managers
  * don't know what they don't know
  * runing 1-1s for example, is an intimidating iexperience the first time you do it; what do you talk about? how do you give feedback? how do you keep track of takeaways?
  * ask your new EM how her 1-1s are going; see what quesitons or challenges she may need help with
  * let her know you'll be holding skip-levels frequently
  * common sign of struggling EM is overwork; probably failing to hand off old responsibilities - HELP identify opportunities to do so
  * overwork also sign of EM who thinks she's in control; taskmastger of the team, making all decisions
  * new EM needs to be on top of team's performance and delivery, guiding them to focus on their goals and deliver results
  * sometimes new EMs fail to realize that htey are now responsible for this delivery, and believe themselves helpless in face of challenging goals or product roadmaps
  * need to coaach them through this process [dmr: everything] at first; set expectation up front that you'll hold her accountable for the team, and help her build the skills to achieve this
  * recommend seeking out additional external training
* managing experienced EMs
  * mgmt tends to be very culture-specific task in a comapny
  * mgrs create sub-cultures
  * skills of modern development best practices and inspiring creative product-centric engineers are more improtant than industry-specific knowledge; easier to gain access to industry info than to reterain someone who doesn't know how to work in your culture
  * think about what your culture values and help your mgrs embody those values
  * experienced person shold be capable of operating independently
  * 1-1s with them are less about nuts and bolts and more about how can have larger impact on strategy and direction setting for the area
  * experienced mgrs often need help expanding their network
* hiring EMs
  * strongly recommend role-playing; ask people who would report to the new EM to ask to help w/ problems they have now, or have had in recent past
  * a mgr must be able to debug teams; describe time ran a project that was behing schedule, what did in that scenario; or how caoched employee struggling and helped great employees grow to new levels
  * how stay hands-on, how delegate?
* managing outside your skill set
  * be very curious
  * not expected to know everything just b/c you're a mgr
  * ask to teach you about the work they do
  * treat as if they were your mentor
  * make clear your goal is to understand what they do so you're capable of appreciating it better
* debugging dysfunctional orgs
  * believe best EMs are often great debuggers
  * obsessive debugging of one-off issues is not always best  use of time, but shows mind that won't be satisfied w/ the unknown
  * managing teams is a series of complex black boxes interacting with other complex black boxes; have inputs and outputs that can be observed, but whenoutputs aren't as expcted, figuring out why require trying to open them up and see what's going on inside
  * just as sometimes don't have source code or it's in a language you don't know or logfiles aren't readable, black boxes of teams can resist yield their inner workings
  * to debug a team, look for a hypothesis on why team is having problems; be minimally invasive
  * not generally single failures, more like performance issues - slow down from time to time, occassional crashes
  * check the data: look at team chats, emails, tickets, code reviews, check-ins; are prod incidents taking up lots of team's time? are people sick? are they bickering over code style? are tickets too vague, too big, too small? are they in meetings all day?
  * sit in on their meetings
  * boring meetings are a sign; may indicate team doesn't feel they can actually help set direction of the team, or choose the work that will happen; signal lack of healthy conflict on a team
  * good meetings have healthy discussion element, where opinoins and ideas drawn out of team; if meetings are overscripted, no real conversation can take place
  * ask questions: what are their goals? do they understand why those are the goals? who are they building systems for? did they have any part in deciding the goals and projects to achieve them? if not, why not?
  * a bunch of people who never talk to each other and are always working on indpendent projects are not really working as a team
  * it's ok to jump in and help debug team issues as you see them, particularly when manager in question is struggling
* setting expectations & delivering on schedule
  * one of most frustrating questions: why is something taking so long?
  * hopefully you're being asked b/c the something is running over plan by a significant margin
  * often asked this when our leadership didn't like the original estimate or didn't ask for it at all
  * you **must** always be aggressive about sharing estimates and updates to estimates, even when people don't ask, especially if you believe the project is critical or likely to take longer than a few weeks
  * be aggressive about getting estimates
  * negotiate the process your team uses to estimate, on what timescale, for what projects
  * engineers often don't want to estimate at all
    * philosophy is completely reasonable if you believe estimates must be fairly accurate, requirements are unknown or will change frequently, most of the work should be bound to features that mostly fit within one or two sprints
    * but few of those things are always true
    * estimates useful even if not perfectly accurate b/c they escalate the complexity to teh rest of the team
    * it's possible to do up-front work to drastically reduce the unknowns
    * businesses that wan to plan and get ideas of cost for effort
    * goal setting and learning how toget better at understanding the complexity of our software
* roadmap uncertainty
  * think about how to break down big projects into series of smaller deliverables, such that you can achieve some of the results even if you don't necessarily complete the grand vision
  * don't overpromise future of technical projects b/c roadmap for "later" hasn't been written yet; if important, get it sheduled now, or as soon to now as possible; once "later" rolls around, will be long list of competing priorities from other parts of business
  * dedicate 20% of team's schedule to "sustaining engineering" - refactoring, fixing outstanding bugs, improving eng process, doing minor cleanup, providing ongoing support
  * understand how important various engineering projects really are
    * how big is the project?
    * how important is it?
    * can you articulate the value of that project to anyone who asks?
    * what would successful completion of the project mean for the team?
    * talk about what will be possible when the work is done
    * never enough time for all the exploratory engineering, legacy code cleanup, and technical quality ipmrovements - pick your battles
  * when projects/teams change, best thing you can do is help people feel capable of tying up loose ends, stabilizing current in-flight projets, easing into their new work in a controlled fashion; this is an area where you can and should push back; get adequate time to finish up current work
* staying technically relevant
  * mgrs who don't stay technical enough sometimes find themselves in bad habit of acting as a go-between for senior mgmt and their teams; instead of filtering requests, they realy them to the team and then relay team's response back up to mgmt; this is not a value-add role
  * if your team invests time poorly, it will reflect on you as their leader for not helping them come to better decisions
  * how should you invest your time in order to stay technically relevant?
    * read the code
    * pick an unknown area, ask an engineer to explain it to you; whiteboard or pair on a small change
    * attend postmortems; may learn that standards you thought were obvious have been neglected or ignored; communication between teams is lacking, tooling is hurting more than helping
    * keep up with industry trends in software development processes
    * foster network of technical people outside your company

## 8 - The Big Leagues

* CTO/VP Eng job can vary highly; but there's a number of specific roles of senior eng leadership positions
  * R&D: in companies focusing on expanding cutting edge of technology, leader focused on experimentation, research, new tech generation; might own tech strategy, or be purely for finding new ideas
  * Technology strategy/visionary: tech strategy meets product development; often also manages product org; focused on how tech can be used to grow the business, predict evolution of tech as it applies to company's industry
  * Organization: guides structure and people; owns plans for staffing team, structure, ensuring projects are staffed accordingly
  * Execution: usually paired with organization, makes sure thigns actually get done; helps align roadmaps, plan work, coordinate large efforts; makes sure projects get prioritized; breaks roadblocks, resolves conflicts, makes decisions to get team moving forward
  * Face of tech, external: useful when company sellings software-based products to other companies, and for building eng brand
  * Infrastructure and technical operations manager: can be cost-focused, security-focused, scaling-focused
  * Business executive: first focus is business; understands industry, other essential functions of business at high level; balances internal dev needs w/ business growth needs, owns prioritization of projects at high level
* VP Eng job is both big one and detail-oriented one; hard to hire for b/c engineers reluctant to trust peopple w/o technical credibility, and mgrs at this level not interested in going through hard technical interview process since role is mostly about organizational managent
* CTO
  * is not necessarily best engineer in the company
  * should be strategic technical executive company needs in its current stage of evolution - changes over time
  * shape business strategy through lends of technology
  * identify areas where tech can be used to create new or bigger lines of business, align w/ overall company strategies, or ensure tech is always evolving to ancipate potential futures of business and product roadmap
  * must protect tech team from becoming pure execution arm for ideas w/o tending to its own needs and ideas
  * difficult to maintain influence and effectiveness as executive w/ no reporting power
  * business strategy job first and foremost; also a mgmt job
* fastest route to being VP of ENg is to get mgmt experience at a larger organization and then join a growing startup
* changing priorities
  * can suddenly get question: so why aren't you working on the top priority
  * when feel need to ask of your own teams, ask yourself why they don't understand what priorities are and what should be cutting to address them
  * many problems will get raised to you and then resolved on their own, so may decide you need degree of sustained struggle from team before it's time to step in
* strategy
  * went from having only vague idea of what setting strategy meant to having concrete, forward-thinking strategy encompassing way to think about both technical architecture and engineering team's structure
  * start by doing research
    * consider team, tech had built, and company
    * ask what pain points are
    * ask execs where they expect growth to come from
    * where scaling challenges are, where might be in future
    * find productivity bottlenecks
    * study tech landscape, how it might change in near future - what changes are key to your business (e.g., personalization, mobile development)
  * strategy meant tech architecture but also team structure and underpinnings of business and directions in which it was headed
  * tech strategy for product-focused companies enables many potential futures of the business; not just reactive document, but anticipates and enables future growth
  * not about deciding product's direction, but enabling larger roadmap to play out successfully
  * hard to make guess about future w/ highly imperfect info
* the echo
  * you're no longer one of the team; first time is peers at leadership/exec level, reporting structure is now second team
  * detach socially from overall org
  * socializing heavily w/ team outside of working hours is thing of the past
  * detach b/c don't want to (or be accused of) playing favorites
  * need to learn to lead effecitvely, requires people to take your words seriously; if maintain buddy image, reports will have hard time distinguishing between buddy thinking out loud and boss asking them to focus on something
  * can no longer be one of the team whose ideas are evaluated and potentially rejected - you are no longer that person
  * transparency that may have been harmless or even possibly helpful at lower levels of mgmt can become incredibly damaging to the stability of the team at this level

## 9 - Bootstraping Culture

* when talking about structure w/ skeptics, reframe: structure --> learning, process --> transparency
  * don't set up systems b/c structure and process have inherent value
  * do it b/c want to learn from successes and mistakes, and share those and encode the lessons in a transparent way
  * think of process as risk mgmt
  * process should have value even when they are not followed perfectly; value should largely lie in act of socializing change or risk to team as a whole
* pick strategy and run w/ it; cultivate decisiveness in face of massive number of options; find something will get you through to the next milestone
* pretending to lack structure tends to create hidden power structures
* reason you find lots of spaghetti code in early startups: when work is done to satisfy an immediate task, in unified code base worked on by team of interchangeables, result is not thoughtful structure, but a tweak here, a hack there - anything to get the job done and moving forward
* structure is how we scale, diversity, and take on more complex long-term tasks
* culture is the generally unspoken shared rules of a community
* reinforce culture by rewarding people for exhibiting its values in a positive way; reach through part of you that is shy about praising people or embarrassed to share your feelings, and go into the part of you that cares about the people you work with
* writing a career ladder
  * use both long-form descriptions and summaries: instead of just visualizing level as set of skills and attributes, long-form ladder reads a bit like a performance review of a person operating well at each level
* structuring cross-functional teams
  * engineers who have best product sense, capable of getting features done quickly and efficiently, who communicate best w/ other functions will start to emerge as leaders of team
  * be aware of product/business vs tech focus and apply where makes sense
