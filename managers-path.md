# The Manager's Path
### A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth & Change
### by Camille Fournier

## Management 101

* expect 1-1s to be scheduled w/ some predictability so you can plan for them
* not your maanger's job to completely control the 1-1 agenda
* getting behavioral feedback can be pretty disorienting thing to have happen
* lots of types of feedback you may want to ask for; key is to ask; figure out what you need and be explicit w/ your mgr
* your mgr should show you larger picture of how your work fits into team's goals
* as you become more senior, amount of personal feedback you get likely to decrease; expect type of feedback to change from personal to team or strategy related input
* as become more senior, mgr expect you to bring solutions, not problems; don't expect mgr to solve problems; when have problem, try asking for advice on how mgr might approach it

## Mentoring

* mentoring means feeling of being responsible for another person
* taste of mgmt
* early lessons in leadership = people are not good at saying precisely what they mean in a way that others can exactly understand
* incredibly important to set expectations - communicate what needs to happen

## Tech Lead

* good communicator, good at prioritizing, eager to push work forward, decide what needed to be done next, and willing to pick up the pieces and do what needed to be done to make progress
* tech lead is not the job for the person who wants the freedom to focus deeply on the details of her own code
* write code, but also represent group to mgmt, vet plans for feature delivery, deal w/ lot of the details of project mgmt process
* tech lead must learn to be strong technical project manager; scale themselves by delegating work effectively w/o micromanaging
* must figure out how to balance technical commitments w/ work the whole team needs
* main roles of tech lead
  * systems architect & business analyst
    * think through externalities and issues related to the project
    * good sense of overall architecture of systems
    * solid understanding of how to design complex software
    * understand business requirements and tranlsate them into software
  * project planner
    * break work down into rough deliverables
    * challenge is getting as much productiv work done in parallel as possible
    * find places to apply agreed-upon aabstractions to parallelize work
    * gataher input from experts on team
    * start identifying priorities; what's critical, what's optional? how can you work on critical early in project?
  * software developer and team lead
    * write code, communicate challenges, delegate
    * you should continue writing code, but not too much
    * even if tempted to pull rabbit out of hat yourself, you must communicate this obstacle first
    * PM should know as early as possible about any possible challenges
    * teams often fail b/c they overworked themselves on a feature that PM would have been willing to compromise on
* agile softare development does not get rid of need for project management
  * agile forces you to focus on breaking tasks down, planning those chunks out, and delivering value incrementally instead of all at once
  * none of this means you don't need to understand how to do project management
* engineers who bleieve in "right tool for the job" [dmr: one of my biggest pet peeves] sometiems turn into process czars when they become tech leads
* better: someone who understand that process must meet needs of team and work
* look for self-regulating processes; see if process itself can be changed to be easier to follow; automation can often make rules more obvious
* how to be a great tech lead
  * understand the architecture
    * understand connections, where data lives, how it flows between systems
    * how it reflects products it is supporing
    * where core logic lives
    * impossible to lead projects well when you don't undersatnd architecture you're changing
  * be a team player
    * stop doing all teh interesting work yourself
    * look at the trickiy, boring, or annoying areas of technical need and try to unstick them
    * less exciting parts of codebase can teach you a lot about where the process is broken
    * if only doing most boring work, stop that; take on some of the harder tasks
    * want to encourage others to learn entire system, give them changes to stretch themselves, but you needn't always be self-sacrificing
  * lead technical decisions
    * being involved in decisions is not same as making all the decisions
    * w/o soliciting input of team, they'll resent you and blame you when things go wrong
    * if you make no technical deicsions, they can drag on w/o resolution
    * make it clear what the matter under discussion is and communicate the outcome
  * communicate
    * your productivity is now less important than the productivity of othe whole team
    * you pay the price of communication overhead
    * instead of every member of team in a meeting, you represen the team, communicate their needs, and bring info from that meeting back to the team
    
## Managing People

* "new manager" is an entry level job w/ no seniority on any front
* 2 jobs: manage individuals while simultaneously being responsible for running a team
* expectation setting by you shoudl include specifics: how often you want to meet, how share info, how often review work, how long they work alone to solve a problem before asking for help
* the to-do list meeting
  * updates are given, decisions are made or discussed, planning happens
  * downside: wonder why you needed to do this synchronously
  * oculd have been handled via chat/email
  * encourage meaningful items for 1-1 discussion, those that need nuance of face-to-face verbal communication
* the catch-up
  * listen to anything direct reports want to discuss
  * as much creative discussion as planning meeting
  * downfall: can turn into complaining session or therapy; unhealthy closeness w/ directs
* feedback meeting
  * informal feedback and coaching
  * regular interval, especially for early-career employees
  * if have performance issues, more frequently; if thinking of firing someone, document the meetings
  * when someone does something that needs immediate corrective feedback, don't wait for 1-1 to provide that feedback
* the progress report
  * when managing ICs, should only do progress report 1-1s for someone who's off on a side project that you're not personally overseeing
  * if your 1-1s are frequently status updates, try breaking out of habit bya sking reports to preapre answer toq uestions that are unrealted ot the current project status, or ask them to come prepared w/ questions for you to answer about the team, the company, or anything else
* getting to know you
  * not suggesting pry into personal lives, but show them you care
* keep notes in shared doc, you as manager playing note taker [dmr: downside if it means looking at laptop during meeting; less personal; i'm going to try writing notes after meeting]
* micromangement vs delegation
  * instead of sitting in on every meeting and tracking every detail, work w/ IC to determine which meetings mgr should attend, help IC undertand which details to escalate; gives IC confidence to run project and understanding that (and how) mgr has ICs back
* use team's goals to understand which details to dig into
  * ask team how they're measuring success, ask them tomake that visible to you on an ongoing basis
  * if team is making progress on its goals, systems are stable, PM is happy, rarely dig into details beyond cursory overview; but requires goals w/ plan for people to be making progress against, and PM who can give you another perspective
  * when managing team that doens't have a clear plan, use details you'd want to monitor to help create one
  * what arey ou holding them accoutable against this month, quarter, year? if you can't answer that questions, first step is to help them create these goals
* gather info from systems before going to the people
  * systems can push valuable info up (version control, ticketing, alerts, metrics, etc)
* adjust focus depending on stage of project
  * during nomrla workflow, usually enough to know what's moving forward, what is taking longer than expected
* estalbish standards for code and systems
  * define what's SOP vs what's exceptional - basic standards
* teach what ICs need to communicate, when, and how
* giving continuous feedback
  * know your people
    * what are their goals, if any?
    * strengths, weaknesses?
    * at what level are they operating?
    * where might they need to improve to get to next level?
    * sit down with every person on team and ask for their perspective on these questions
  * observe your people
    * attempting continuous feedback forces you to start paying attentino to individuals on your team
    * practice looking for talents and achievements
    * give specific praise
  * provide lightweight, regular feedback
  * provide coaching
    * use coaching to ask people what they might have done differently
    * many people will be content w/ doing the job they know how to do well, as long as they are doing it well enough, it's not good use of your time to coach tehm; save valuable coaching time for those who are receptive to it
* performance reviews
  * if feedback seems valuable for person to hear, share it, but don't just blindly report all grudges
  * when very little meaningful feedback for improvement, indicates person is ready to be promoted or given more challenging work
  * some people may never need to be promoted out of their current level, but they can also grow by focusing on new technical learning opportunities
  * avoid surprises
    * if someon recently promoted, set expectation that review will be based on higher standards
* person who has potential but isn't yet showing equivalent performance is showing up for the team in a way that others do not, even if her work is slow-going
* understand that promotions involve playing a game at any sizable company; will be reviewed by your manager and committee, prepare them with the info they need to succeed
  * learn how to play the game at your company
  * if you don't know, ask your mgr for advice
  * how are decisions made? how early do you need to start preparing packets?
  * are there limits on the number of promotions that can happen in a given year?
  * be transparent with your team about why they're not getting promoted - what they need to do to make a stronger case next time
  * idetnify promotion-worthy projects, given those to people who are close to promotion
* if there's no growth potential on your team b/c there's no room for people to work at a more senior level, may be sign that you need to rethink way work is done in order to let individuals take on bigger responsibilities
* if you avoid tackling negative feedback until it builds to boiling point, you're going to be met w/ pile of excuses, and then what do you do?
* "coaching out": make situation clear to IC; have told them repeatedly what next level looks like, they haven't been able to shwo they can work at that level, so you don't think your team is the right place for them to grow their career; aren't firing them, but you are telling them that they need to move on if they want to progress

## Managing a Team

* identify bottlenecks in progress, roadblocks to success; clear them
* identify most high-value projects, keep team focused on them
* idnetify headcount needs for team, plan and recruit
* communicate expectations clearly to all team members
* deliver individual feedback frequently
* act as leader for technical roadmap; clearly communicate timeline, scope, and risks, lead delivery of major initiatives on clear timelines
* identify areas fo strategic techniacl debt, do cost/benefit analysis for resolving it
* when working with more senior engineers than you are, talk about how everyone has a job to do; EMs is to help them succeed however EM can; being good manager isn't about having most technical knowledge
* negative person easier to deal w/ than brilliant jerk; make it clear behavior has to change, bring clear examples, provide corretive feedback quickly after things happen
* humans need context on why goals have been set; can't shield team from everything happening or they may lack that context
* role in decision making process is to drive good decisions
  * PM owns product roadmap
  * tech lead is deep in tech, but also thinking about project mgmt and work that needs to be done
  * you are accoutable for team's progress through each of these elements
  * while you may only have the authority to guide decisions rather than dictate them, you'll still be judged by how well those decisions turn out
* use data
  * team productivity (time to complete features)
  * quality measures (how mcuh tiem spent dealing with outages, number of bugs found in QA or after releases)
* create safe environemtn for diagreement to work itself out
* managing conflict
  * don't rely exclusively on consensus or voting
  * set up clear processes to depersonalize decisions (aka, guide) - provide clear set of standards to evaluate decisions; start w/ shared understanding of goals, risks, questons to answer
  * don't turn blind eye to simmering issues
  * address issues w/o courting drama; goal is to identify problems that are causing the team to work less effectively together and resolve tehm, not to become the team's therapist
* nice vs kind: nice is good in casual conversation; as mgr, important ot be kind instead. e.g., it's kind to tell someone who isn't ready for promotion that they're not ready; unkind to lead that person on saying "Maybe you coudl get promoted"
* underpinning of a successful team is psychological safety: team whose members are wiling to take risks and make mistakes in front of one another
* the brilliant jerk
  * all evidence in the world can't change a person who doesn't want to change
  * best thing for team is to refuse to tolerate bad behavior
  * few instances where okay to criticize in public
  * keep feedback neutral but to the point
  * only for behavior you believe is detrimental to the whole group; if just undermining you personally, discuss in private
* employee who lacks respect -  ask if she wants to be working on your team
* advanced project mgmt
  * none of this is a replacement for agile project mgmt
    * teams have both high-level, long-term goals and short-term objetives to meet those goals
    * agile process where team collaborates to divide and roughly estimate work is very effective at smoothing and organizing the day-to-day
    * as mgr, you're not trying to disrupt or even own that part of the execution process
    * you are responsible for the larger picture - accomplishments that are measured in months intead of weeks - and this is where you have to start exerting some higher-level planning
  * 10 productive engineering weeks of focused effort per engineer per quarter
  * q1 most productive, q4 least
  * budget 20% time for generic sustaining engineering work across the board - testing, debugging, cleaning up legacy code, migrating language or platform versions, etc
  * it's your job to say no as you approach deadlines
    * will almost certainly have deadlines, either goal dates that you've set or that came from on high
    * only way to achieve them is to cut scope at end of project
    * partner with tech lead and product lead / business rep to figure out what "must-haves" are not actually that
    * figure out when to push for hack implementation, when to hold back for right implementation
  * use doubling rule for quick estiamtes, push for planning team to estimate longer tasks
    * when asked for off-the-cuff guess, double
    * when talking about projeects longer than a couple of weeks, make it clear you'll need some planning time before you're sure about the timescale
  * be selective about what you bring to the team to estimate
    * part of your job is to handle uncertainty, limit how much of that uncertainty you expose to your team

## Managing Multiple Teams

* strong technical background
* spend some of time researching new technologies and staying abreast of tends in tech industry
* expected to help debug and triage critical systems
* understand systems they oversee well enough to do code reviews, research problems as needed
* contirbute to architecture and design efforts by serving as tech savvy voice that asks business and product questions of engineers
* primarly concerned w/ ensuring smooth execution fo complex deliverables
* responsible for guiding goal-setting process for all teams in org, helping these teams articulate goals that support both business initiatives and technology and organizational quality
* ways to stay hands-on that don't require wiring a lot of production code: code reviews, debugging and prod support
* even if don't write much code, keep at least solid half-day once a week completely free from meetings for creative pursuit; write blog posts, prep conference talks, participate in open source project; scratch creative itch
* key skill is understanding difference between importance and urgency

|   | Not urgent | Urgent |
|-----|--------|------|
|Important | Strategic: make time | Obvious work |
|Unimportant | Obvious avoid | Tempting distractions (danger zone) |

* urgency is often more clearly felt than importance
* manage time by, e.g., reading and responsing to email at specific times of day
* important but not urgent: preparing for meetings so you can guide them in a healthy way
  * culture that favors short but productive meetings requires participants do some up-front work to come to the meeting prepared
  * hold people accountable to prepare in whatever way makes sense
  * ask for agenda items up front
  * any standard meeting should have clear procedure and expected outcomes
* urgent but not important meetings can be tempting to not attend; be careful to over-deploy this strategy; your attendance at these meetings is partially to pay attention to the dynamics and morale of your team
* have mental list of things about what your team needs; that you're monitoring, trying to fix, trying to find for them
* decisions and delegation

| | Frequent | Infrequent |
|--|---|---|
| Simple | Delegate | Do it yourself |
| Complex | Can delegate (carefully) | Can delegate for training purposes |

* delegate simple and frequent tasks
  * running daily standups, writing summary of team's progress each week, conducting minor code reviews
  * tech leads or other senior engineers can take responsibility for those tasks, may not even need training to do them
* simple and infrequent do yourself
  * if faster to do it yourself than explaining to someone else, and rarely needs to be done, do it
* complex and infrequent tasks as training opportunities for rising leaders
  * writing performance reviews, making hiring plans are skills you'll want to pass on to rising mgrs
  * may have tech lead sit with you to write perf review for an intern
  * have senior eng provide feedback on how many new people believes needed to support a project next year
* delegate complex & frequent tasks to develop team
  * project planning, systems design, being key person during outage are biggest opportunity to grow talent while making team run better
  * goal is to make teams capable of operating at high level w/o much input from you
  * are your teams learning how to operate independently, or are you keeping them dependent on you for critical functions? list taks you and only you know how to do for the team; many are important to teach your teams to accomplish themselves
  * project mgmt, onbaording new team members, working w/ product team to break down roadmap goals into technical deliverables, production support
* delegation is a process that starts slwo but turns into essential element for career growth
